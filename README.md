hello my name is Islam al-Attar, i study computer science and i'm doing my last semester and hopefully will graduate within 2 weeks.

blockquote I have learnt that’s the purpose of the software is to help people and simplify it to them as much as possible. The source of many software failures is **complexity** and that our main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it. I have learnt that misunderstanding leads to complexity which will leads to more misunderstanding and get this even more complex than before, a good developer is doing everything they can to make the code as simple as possible
And there is maintenance which is one of the ***most important*** things in software development but unfortunately developers usually ignore how important it is and the developer skills with problem solving and how he prioritize things.

and as Richard Feynman said
> If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.
